title: Don't Mistake Me

Yeah! [My 2nd track]({{ site.github.url }}/about/). This post documents the 5 stories I need to complete each week for each track: analysis, core, arrangement, lyrics, production.

### Analysis

This week, I chose to analyze the infamous Beatles classic, [She Loves You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Loves_You).

_I will soon post my notes here!_

### Core

Here is my initial idea stemming from the analysis. At this stage, I want to keep things simple (transitions are not completely vetted out) but you should be able to make out a chorus, verse and lift.

### Lyrical

_Wait for it. Sometime late mid week!_

### Production

_Wait for it. Toward the end of the week!_
