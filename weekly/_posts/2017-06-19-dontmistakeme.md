title: Don't Mistake Me
---

Yeah! [My 2nd track]({{ site.github.url }}/about/). This post documents the 5 stories I need to complete each week for each track: analysis, core, arrangement, lyrics, production.

### Analysis

This week, I chose to analyze the infamous Beatles classic, [She Loves You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Loves_You).

Great track. If you get a chance to listen, note:

- the story and purpose behind the song
- the chord progression
- the constant dip and rise in tension, ebb and flow
- the relationship of the melody to the corresponding chords
- no distinct bridge

### Core

<audio controls onPlay="pauseAudio('arr')" id="core">

</audio>

At this stage, I want to keep things simple (transitions are not completely vetted out) but you should be able to make out a chorus, verse and lift.

This melody was slightly different - it is in triplet time and as such, has a different groove to it. I'm still working to create pieces that fit together. I found myself rushed this week and want to take a bit more time in this stage going forward.

### Arrangement

<audio controls onPlay="pauseAudio('core')" id="arr">
  <source src="{{ site.github.url }}/weekly/audio/20170619-dontmistakeme2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
	  Sorry, this browser does not support embedded audio.
  </source>
</audio>

This week, I really emphasized the groove in the kick and bass. Per a few folks comments, I kept the original melodic idea line in the final arrangement. I hope to start removing that once I get some actually singing going on! These are not meant to be instrumentals per se.

### Lyrical

Whoa - its hard to get to this each week. Haven't finished this step yet.

### Production

Again, just running out of time each week for this. Part of my problem here is that I can't really rush production - it is one of the longer, drawn out parts of the process for me currently.

### Final

I've uploaded the latest version of the track to [Sound Cloud](https://soundcloud.com/lutherbaker/dont-mistake-me) so take a listen and let me know what you think. I'd certainly appreciate the feedback.
