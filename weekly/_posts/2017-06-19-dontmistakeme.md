title: Don't Mistake Me
---

Yeah! [My 2nd track]({{ site.github.url }}/about/). This post documents the 5 stories I need to complete each week for each track: analysis, core, arrangement, lyrics, production.

### Analysis

This week, I chose to analyze the infamous Beatles classic, [She Loves You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Loves_You).

_I will soon post my notes here!_

### Core

Here is my initial idea stemming from the analysis. At this stage, I want to keep things simple (transitions are not completely vetted out) but you should be able to make out a chorus, verse and lift.

<audio controls onPlay="pauseAudio('arr')" id="core">
  <source src="{{ site.github.url }}/weekly/audio/20170619-dontmistakeme.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
	  Sorry, this browser does not support embedded audio.
  </source>
</audio>

### Arrangement

<audio controls onPlay="pauseAudio('core')" id="arr">
  <source src="{{ site.github.url }}/weekly/audio/20170619-dontmistakeme2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
	  Sorry, this browser does not support embedded audio.
  </source>
</audio>

### Lyrical

Whoa - its hard to get to this each week. Haven't finished this step yet.

### Production

Again, just running out of time each week for this. Part of my problem here is that I can't really rush production - it is one of the longer, drawn out parts of the process for me currently.
